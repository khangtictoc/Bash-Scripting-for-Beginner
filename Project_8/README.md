# Scenario

You have been provided with a text file called `​urls.txt`​ which contains a list of website URLs. 

You can find this file in the resources section for this project. 

You have been asked to obtain the header information received when trying to access the homepage for all these sites, and store these headers in individual text files.

> Note: The name of the text files should be based on the url.

E.g.
```
www.​facebook​.com -> ​facebook​.txt
www.​google​.com > ​google​.txt
www.​thingy​.net > ​thing​.txt
```
