# Scenario

Keeping your system up to date is always a very important part of running a stable system.

In this project, we are going to create a script that will update your system everyday at midnight.

We are choosing midnight because this would hopefully be a time when your boss isnâ€™t demanding you to be in the office, so this update can be done without causing disruption.

That said, feel free to customise the execution time for this script based on your daily schedule

# Your Task

You could do the `cronjob` task yourself.
