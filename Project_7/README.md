# Scenario

You are tasked with setting up the folder structure for a shared network drive, and have been given a text file, ​`folders_to_create.txt`​, which contains a list of directory names that need to be created. 

You need to create a script that will read the text file, and create all these folders. 

> Advice:​ Test this script from within a new empty folder -- it can get a bit messy!
