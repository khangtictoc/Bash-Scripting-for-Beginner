# Scenario

You work for a development firm and your team wants to receive updates on the server load on a daily basis. 

You are asked to create a script that will monitor our serverâ€™s performance and log key information into a file. 

You will then pull this file to your laptop on a daily basis so you always have key metrics to hand.

# Your Task

You don't need to pull to a remote server if you don't have any resources to do. Otherwise, you can set up a remote VMware and set up `ssh` service.
